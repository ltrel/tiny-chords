# TinyChords - The Harmonic Progression Compression Tool ðŸŽ¹
Do you ever find yourself needing chord charts to your friends in an absurdly
space-efficient manner? If for some bizarre reason your answer to this question
is 'yes', then TinyChords is the tool for you!

This work-in-progress project can take your harmonic sketches from a bulky
human-readable JSON representation to a highly efficient binary encoding that
won't waste a single bit.
